# sample-gke-hello-world

This is a project done during classes in the course "KUBERNETES: PODS, SERVICES E CONFIGMAPS" at Alura school,
I had the freedom to run this project on GKE and so the steps below for execution were written based on the GKE structure.

Below is the link to my course completion certificate:

## How to Run

1. Copy and paste the folders listed below into the root of your GKE Cluster:
```sh
- db
- sistema
```

2. In the CLI of your GKE Cluster, execute the commands in sequence:
```sh
# Creating and exposing the database Pod
cd db

# Creating the ConfigMap
kubectl apply -f db-configmap.yaml

# Creating the Pod
kubectl apply -f db-noticias.yaml

# Creating the Load Balancer Service
kubectl apply -f svc-db-noticias.yaml

# Creating and exposing the Sistema Pod
cd ../sistema

# Creating the ConfigMap
kubectl apply -f sistema-configmap.yaml

# Creating the Pod
kubectl apply -f sistema-noticias.yaml

# Creating the Load Balancer Service
kubectl apply -f svc-sistema-noticias.yaml
```

3. In the Services & Ingress menu, copy the IP from the Endpoints column of the svc-sistema-noticias

4. Paste the previously copied IP into the file portal/portal-configmap.yaml in the parameter value IP_SISTEMA, the code should look similar to the one below:
```sh
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: portal-configmap
data:
  IP_SISTEMA: http://35.223.47.76
```

Obs: 
  - The IP prefix must be http:// and not https://;
  - Be careful when copying the IP with a slash at the end, leaving 35.223.47.76/, this slash at the end will result in the portal not being able to access the sistema-noticias pod API:

5. Copy and paste the portal folder into the root of your GKE Cluster;

6. In the CLI of your GKE Cluster, execute the commands in sequence:
```sh
# Creating and exposing the Portal Pod
cd portal

# Creating the ConfigMap
kubectl apply -f portal-configmap.yaml

# Creating the Pod
kubectl apply -f portal-noticias.yaml

# Creating the Load Balancer Service
kubectl apply -f svc-portal-noticias.yaml
```

## How to Access

After all Pods and Services are running, perform the following steps to test:

1. In the GKE Services & Ingress menu, click on the IP in the Endpoints column of the svc-sistema-noticias service;
2. Enter the access data below to access:
```sh
- Username: admin
- Password: admin
```

3. Click on the blue "Nova Not√≠cia" button;
4. Register a news item in the form within the modal that appears;
5. Back in GKE, in the Services & Ingress menu, click on the IP in the Endpoints column of the svc-portal-noticias;
6. A page will open displaying the news you previously registered;
